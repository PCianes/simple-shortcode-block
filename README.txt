A simple block to render a shortcode in a dynamic way into the new editor Gutenberg.

== Description ==

A simple block to the new WordPress editor Gutenberg to insert and show also in the backend all your old shortcodes.

This block allows you to work with shortcodes into Gutenberg like the native WordPress Block, but with a new feature: ** You can see ( in many case ) the shortcodes in the backend in a similar way as render in the frontend of the web **

Now is very easy to see what your shortcodes are going to show in the web thanks of Gutenberg and this dynamic simple shortcode block.

** Do not you see what you expected? Not always is possible to see the shortcode in the backend as in the frontend ** because of it is depend on each plugin and also your active theme, but this plugin allow you to try with some options to improve this:
*   Select to include some CSS of the plugin into Gutenberg editor for each shortcode block.
*   Select to include some JS of the plugin into Gutenberg editor for each shortcode block.
*   Hide / Show the input where you put the shortcode to avoid to see it into the editor (see the third Screenshot).

What You See in the backend with Gutenberg editor Is ( in many case ) What You Get! and the plugin only enqueue the selected assets if it is necesary to improve the apparience between backend and frontend.
